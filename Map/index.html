            <p>For my YR13 CMP I designed a solarpunk redevlopment of the land currently taken up by heathrow part of that was designing a map to show the transport links in the area in a design that feels familiar to users of TfL maps but has a few aditions to the visual heirarchy to better show the modes in use the area. I made it in illustrator with a few technical errors but nothing major especially considering my sleep deprivation and I feel it acheved what I aimed for.</p>

            <p>I have an an ongoing backburner project of algorithmicly solving a somewhat functional map of London's hundereds of quite localy confined bus routs in a S-bahn style service with parallel lines of diffent shades and color groups for overlaping service. However it is currently in protyping API scraping and data organisational stage I shall update this when I have something to show.</p>
