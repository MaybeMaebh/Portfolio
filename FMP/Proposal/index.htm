      <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
      <h2>Maebh Thomas: Maebh's Urbanity</h2>
      <img src="Proposal.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>An informative organic campain-based city builder</p>

      <h2>Rational:</h2>
      <p>During this cource I have acquired and more importantly developed many diverse design-related skillsets and made sure to also focus on these same skills and software packages from a more development-related angle that I was  more previosly expreienced with. I now found I am most engaged and uniquely skilled in the intersection of art/design and technical apects of grathics, especially involving many different diciplins in one progect. In terms of as-close-to-tradional-as-posible positions that puts me between the enigeneer position of a grathics programer or the artist position of technical artist. It also makes a good basis for indie development. This basis of understanding of what engages me and skills to develop thurver is what has been most educational. In my FMP, I whould like to showcase my skills for studio and indie positions and provide a tested base concept to be used for a commecially viable solo indie project.</p>

      <h2>Project Concept:</h2>
      <p>I want to make the following deliverables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A sizable demo for an informative organic campaign-based city-builder (web/desktop app),</li>
        <li>assets for a steam page (animated gifs + 2D art)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It should to be the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessible and entertaining to a range of demographics not familiar with city-builder concepts,</li>
        <li>showing diverse urban, architectural and transportational forms,</li>
        <li>playable on most contemporary hardware,</li>
        <li>teaching modern sustainable planning practices and understanding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I will use the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A ECS game framework on</li>
        <li>a live linux development environment,</li>
        <li>our college texture library,</li>
        <li>Photoshop and CSP for 2D manipulation with college graphics tablets for some assets which can be fitted into the time I have with them,</li>
        <li>in department and online friend-group informal discussion and forms.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Evaluation:</h2>
      <p>I will take feedback at the start, end and throughout through informal discussions and forms in the classroom and in a more varied friend group, though it is still a relatively small age (16-19), location (pretty much just Londoners) and social outlook (all left-wing) variety. I will attempt to get more varied feedback sources in my final evaluation as one of my aims is to be accessible to a large demographic variety, however doing this throughout would be too costly as it requires specifically seeking and overseeing testers.</p>
      <p>I will seek comparision to profesional published games as I want to aim to showcase features that are genuinly inovitive, while accepting I cannot create a larger or universally supparsing (even demo of ) product.</p>
      <p>I will record thought making processes in a notebook and technical changes and reasoning behind them will be recorded in Git version control with automatic enforcing that I justify any change to future me.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Action Plan:</h2>
      <img src="Gannt.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>To work out scope, especially considering my mental instability requiring I stay ahead and aware of how the remaining work can be scaled, I seperated the project into the major sections of work, as well as estimating relitive time cost; By putting this onto a rough Gantt chart I can work out a feasible amount of time that can be allocated to each bit.</p>
      <img src="GanntSheet.png" width="100%">
      <p>Due to afformentioned mental instability I dound my self missing quite a lot of the earlier planned weeks and needed a gannt chart with more detail and dynamic flexibility, so I made an smart spread sheet Gannt chart showing the different sections of each part and how the need to be ordered to be build off eachover.</p>
