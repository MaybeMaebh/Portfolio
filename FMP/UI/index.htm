      <p>I also though about their use in Vr in a way that makes them feel like a part of the controller and not intrude on immersion and though this could be good for my aim of building empathy, with more speed then skuemorthism, though that is still used for detailed info.</p>

      <p>I'm taking insperation from modern intuitiver CAD like sketchup and more recently Shapr3D to design the shape of pannel buildings and the surfaces for roads or putting descreet housing in. as well as defining dsurfaces over a width from a spline</p>
