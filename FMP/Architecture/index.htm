      <h2>Recearch</h2>
      <h2>Large Buildings</h2>
      <p>A large start was my previose recearch into post-war prefab systems and modernist estates; as well as lightly into modern modular cladding systems:</p>

      <img src="Research Maebh Thomas CMP 2023 .svg" width="100%">
      <p>I also did some additional recearch and found that though many different modern construction techniques exist such as</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3D volumetric construction,</li>
        <li>Flat slabs,</li>
        <li>Timber frames,</li>
        <li>Precast panels,</li>
        <li>Concrete walls and floors,</li>
        <li>Precast foundations,</li>
        <li>Twin wall technology;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Almost all of these ended up with externally manafactured pannels which repeat on large buildings, so are technically simular for an external-viewed game; the only exeption is a few modern on-sight brick base construction techniques but they are effectivly just smaller pannels.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Individual classical buildings</h2>
      <p>Though smaller building's use simular teqniques, they can have specific pannels for their builds which are only used once per side for specific designs; because of this, buildings need to be pre-modeled individualy but can have modular parts and visual material variation to reduce work for many variations. In master planed communities symular tachniques can be seen.</p>
      <img src="Terraced.jpg" width="100%">
      <p>The type of descreate buildings I'm familar with are like all buildings built off and relivtive to the street, specifically though they take up the whole width of their street access and share wall shape with neighnouring buildings, with garden in the gaps between going back from the house, sometime a path or alley instead.</p>
      <img src="SingleFamilyDetached.png" width="100%">
      <p>Newer suberban sprawl(post-war-ish) often instead usies detatched plot based housing where land is first devided into plots by area then a house is placed in with a fixed distance from the street (based on flawed car sadftey ideas), surrounded by lawn, with fence on all sides.</p>
